* nfo2mkv

A small script that (hopefully) does what it says on the tin: Transform
metatdata from .NFO files to Matroska tags, both for Movies as well as TV
shows.

Alpha Quality, here be dragons. Currently used with NFO files generated by
[[https://www.tinymediamanager.org/][tinyMediaManager]].

** Usage

#+BEGIN_SRC text
./nfo2mkv.pl [--verbose] (--tvshow=tvshow.nfo --episode=Foo_SXXEYY.nfo | --movie=Movie.nfo) [--xml=mkvtags_out.xml] [--mkv=Foo_SXXEYY.mkv]
	--help           Show this helpmessage
	--verbose        Be verbose while processing data
	--tvshow=FILE    Input: The NFO-file for the overall tv-shwo
	--episode=FILE   Input: The NFO-file for the individual episode
	--movie=FILE     Input: The NFO-file for the movie file
	--xml=FILE       Output, optional: The Matroska tags in XML format
	--mkv=FILE       Output, optional: Apply the tags to this file using mkvpropedit from the MKVToolnix suite

Please note that --movie as opposed to the pair --tvshow and --episode are mutually exclusive.
--mkv expects mkvpropedit to be in your PATH
#+END_SRC

The generated XML is compatible with =mkvpropedit --tags=, that is the
following command can be used to apply the tags to an existing mkvfile.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
mkvpropedit $mkvfile --tags all:$XMLFIL
#+END_SRC

** Dependencies

A perl interpreter, the libraries documented in the
[[./cpanfile][cpanfile]] as well as mkvpropedit if the =--mkv= option is
used.
